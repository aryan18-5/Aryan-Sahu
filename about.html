      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>Good morning, my name is Aryan Sahu, and I am a secondary education student at Gurukul Kurukshetra Haryana's no. 01 Residential school with a focus in science. I grew up in a family of teachers and know that being a high school science teacher is my calling. My passion for helping others has been evident in my involvement as a camp counselor for the last three years.</p>
      <p>Through those experiences, I have learned to interact with a diverse group of people, which has increased my ability to relate to others. I have also had the opportunity to create lessons for the campers that focused on life skills like teamwork, communication, and time management.</p>
      <p>Having been a teacher yourself, what things should I be doing now to prepare for my internship search?</p>
